					<P>	
						Hello World!  I'm new to Web Development and I know that I have a lot to learn.  Going through the process is going to be very hard but nothing great happens easily!
						I know there will be times when I'm doubtful of my abilities or times that I don't understand the content we're covering but I made a commitment and no one forced me to be here, So I will Prevail!
					</P>

	
					<p>
						I want to become a Web Developer and I'm looking to start a new career.  I want to work in a field I always feel I can improve my skill set and have an upard mobility.  On top of the field growing, a promising career is within the grasp of anyone who can learn.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						A few things I personally enjoy are Going to Rock Concerts, playing sports, watching movies, hiking, traveling.
